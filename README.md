# NDSToolkit

The NDSToolkit is an R package containing a number of functions for nonlinear dynamical systems analyses. Specifically, this package contains the following functions:

- Burstiness for event-based sequences
- Burstiness for time-based sequences
- Orbital decomposition
- State Space Grid graphics for sequences of categorical or logical variables

This package also contains a number of datasets

- Sample categorical sequence from Guastello (2011)

There are several additional functions planned (as of 2 June 2022), including some bootstrap confidence intervals for most of the above metrics, etc.
